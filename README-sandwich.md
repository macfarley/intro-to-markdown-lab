## It all starts with the bread
Some people will say the bread is not important, that it is just the vehicle for the dish.  Those people lack creativity and vision.  The perfect bread can make or break a great sandwich, so don't cheap out with some mass-produced and overy-preseved, *over-sugared* bread.

### Home-Made Bread
>This can be inconvenient if you don't have a breadmaker, but you have the benefit of knowing it's fresh and what allergens may be present.
### Store-Bought Bread
Here are some tasty varieties you can find in your local supermarket or bakery.

-Herb de Provance

-Pumpernickel

-Rye (several varieties)
    
    +Light
    
    +Dark
    
    +Marbled

-Ciabatta

## Sauces
Nobody likes a dry sandwich, but choose carefully, and don't over-wet your sandwhich.
1. Creamy/Oil-based Sauces
    * Oilve oil
    * Mayonaise
    * Aoili
    * Italian Dressing
2. Mustards
    * Yellow
    * Coarse Brown
    * Horseradish
3. ~~Ketchup~~
    * You're a grown up, time to forget about ketchup.

## Deli Meat
    
    - Turkey (black pepper roasted)
    - Pastrami
    - Ham (real smoked)
### Bacon
Deseves it's own section because not only is it delicious in most sandwiches, you can use the grease (sometimes known as lard) to lend flavor to other elements, like caramelizing onions.

## Cheese
Many acceptable options here:
    -Havarti with Dill
    -Sharp Cheddar
    -Pepper Jack

## Vegetables
Many debates could be had on what goes inside a sandwich.  As long as it's edible, botanical and slices thin go crazy.

## Garnishes
One of the most important defining charactaristics of a sandwich is that it's **portable** and ***hand-held***.  If your sandqich is too unwieldy consider a classic toothpick and olive to hold your bread togehter long enough to enjoy.
Also, pickles are always good on the side rather than making your sandwich wetter.
